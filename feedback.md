## Project Workflow

**Meets Expectations**

Readme looks great!! In the future, please include setup instructions like `rake db:create db:migrate...`. This will be useful
for future you and potential technical employers who might not be familiar with rails.

## Technical Requirements

**Exceeds Expectations**

Excellent job implementing the `has_many_through` association and the your custom invite implementation!! Your CSS looks
great too. In the future, consider adding Active Record Validations, and restricting who can CRUD depending on who created
the object in the DB.

## Creativity / Interface

**Exceeds Expectations**

Again, CSS is awesome! The header image is a little large - I recommend keeping this only on the home page
or setting as a background so the user doesn't have to scroll when the page refreshes.

## Deployment and Functionality

**Exceeds Expectations**

I was unable to produce any errors when creating an apartment, associated expenses, and cleaning the slate. Check out
my code comments about handling the intermittent Math errors. I'm also happy to pair with you on this - let me know
if you'd like to!
