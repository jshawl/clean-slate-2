For my second project, I'd like to create a "Clean Slate" app in rails that will allow roommates to track apartment expenses over the course of a month, and then use a "settle up" function to determine who owes what to whom at the end of the month. This app will make cost-sharing more organized and reduce the time and energy roommates need to devote to tallying up expenses and splitting them evenly among household members.
